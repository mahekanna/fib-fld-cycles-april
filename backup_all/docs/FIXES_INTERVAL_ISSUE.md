# Dashboard Interval Selection Fix

## Issue
When changing the timeframe in the dashboard (e.g., from daily to 15min), the charts and analysis were not updating correctly. The dashboard consistently displayed daily data for every timeframe.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **CRITICAL BUG - Silent Default to Daily Data**: Found a critical bug in the fetcher.py file where unrecognized intervals would silently default to daily data:
   ```python
   # This line was causing all timeframe issues:
   tv_interval = interval_map.get(interval, Interval.in_daily)
   ```
   This means that even when the system correctly passed "15m" as the interval, if there was any mismatch in the expected format (e.g., "15m" vs "15min"), it would silently fall back to daily data without any error.

2. **Caching Issue**: Data for each interval was being cached, but the cache wasn't being properly invalidated when switching intervals.

3. **Force Download Not Used**: When requesting data for a new interval, the system was checking the cache first and often using cached daily data.

4. **Inconsistent Parameter Passing**: The interval parameter was being passed correctly through the UI, but not consistently forcing a refresh of data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Critical Bug Fix in DataFetcher (data/fetcher.py)
- Fixed the critical bug that was causing all interval issues:
  ```python
  # OLD - Silently defaulted to daily data:
  tv_interval = interval_map.get(interval, Interval.in_daily)
  
  # NEW - Raises an error for unknown intervals instead of silent default:
  if interval not in interval_map:
      error_msg = f"Unrecognized interval: '{interval}'. Must be one of: {list(interval_map.keys())}"
      logger.error(error_msg)
      raise ValueError(error_msg)
      
  tv_interval = interval_map[interval]
  ```
- This ensures that interval mismatches will cause an explicit error instead of silently using daily data

### 2. Dashboard Implementation (web/dashboard_implementation.py)
- Added cache clearing for the selected interval in the `scan_symbol` and `scan_batch` functions
- Added debug logging to track the interval being used
- Modified data fetching logic to use `force_download=True` when retrieving data for visualization
- Added explicit console log messages to help track the interval selection

### 3. Scanner System (core/scanner_system.py)
- Modified the `analyze_symbol` method to force download fresh data for the selected interval
- Added explicit logging of the interval being used

### 4. Error Handling
- Added additional error handling around cache clearing operations
- Improved feedback to show when cache files are cleared for an interval

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Run the dashboard with: `python main_dashboard.py`
2. Select different timeframes (daily, 4h, 1h, 15m) for a symbol
3. Click the "Scan" button after each selection
4. Verify that the charts and analysis update correctly for each timeframe

## Technical Note
The root issue was in how the data fetching and caching worked with the dashboard. The dashboard needs to explicitly force a refresh of data when the interval changes, which our fixes now ensure.

The data_fetcher still uses the original implementation under the hood, but now correctly handles forced refreshes between different timeframes.
