# Logging System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the centralized logging system for the Fibonacci Cycle Trading System. The logging system provides consistent logging across all components of the application, with proper log rotation, component-specific loggers, and session logging.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Centralized Module**: `utils/logging_utils.py`
   - Contains all logging configuration and utilities
   - Provides component-specific loggers, log rotation, and session logging
   - Includes convenience functions for getting loggers and handling exceptions
   - Implements a `LogManager` class for managing multiple loggers

2. **Key Files Updated**:
   - `main_dashboard.py`: Dashboard now uses the centralized logging system
   - `web/backtest_ui.py`: Backtesting UI now uses component-specific logger
   - `core/scanner_system.py`: Scanner now uses the centralized logger or a provided logger
   - `data/data_management.py`: Data fetcher now uses the centralized logger
   - `run.py`: Main entry point initializes the logging system and provides proper error handling

3. **Testing**:
   - `test_logging.py`: Test script for verifying all logging functionality
   - Tests basic logging, component loggers, exception logging, log level changes, session logging, and log file creation

4. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/LOGGING.md`: Documentation for using the logging system
   - Added logging information to the README.md

## Architecture

The logging system follows a hierarchical design:

1. **Root Logger**: Configured by `configure_root_logger()` function 
   - Handles all uncaught exceptions
   - Logs to console and main log file

2. **Component Loggers**: Created by `get_component_logger()` function
   - Each component gets its own logger with appropriate namespace
   - Component logs are written to component-specific log files

3. **Session Loggers**: Created by `log_manager.create_session_log()` method
   - For tracking specific application runs
   - Creates timestamped log files

4. **LogManager Class**: Central management class
   - Manages all loggers in the application
   - Provides utility methods for getting loggers, setting log levels, etc.

## Key Features

1. **Log Rotation**: Log files are automatically rotated when they reach a certain size
2. **Component Isolation**: Each component logs to its own file
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: Components gracefully fall back to standard logging if centralized system is unavailable
4. **Session Tracking**: Special session logs for tracking specific application runs
5. **Exception Handling**: Utilities for consistent exception logging
6. **Integration with run.py**: Single entry point initializes the logging system

## Future Improvements

1. **Remote Logging**: Add support for sending logs to remote logging services
2. **Log Aggregation**: Implement centralized log viewing in the dashboard
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Add more sophisticated log filtering options
4. **Performance Metrics**: Add performance tracking and metrics to logs
5. **Security Logging**: Add specific security-related logging
