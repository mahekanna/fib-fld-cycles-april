# Data Fetching System Fixes

## Issue
The data fetching logic in the system had been overly complicated and moved away from the original implementation, causing issues with data retrieval and processing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Restored Original DataFetcher Implementation
- Replaced the complex DataFetcher in `fetcher.py` with the original implementation from the golden cycles project
- The original implementation uses a simpler and more reliable approach with TvDatafeed as the primary data source
- Simplified caching mechanism using pickle files instead of SQLite database

### 2. Created Compatibility Layer
- Modified `data_management.py` to act as a compatibility layer
- Created a wrapper DataFetcher class that maintains the expected API interface
- This wrapper uses the original implementation internally
- Preserved the DataProcessor class for backward compatibility

### 3. Key Improvements
- Removed dependency on multiple data sources (Yahoo Finance, etc.)
- Eliminated complex initialization logic
- Restored the original caching mechanism
- Simplified the overall data flow

## Original vs. New Implementation

### Original Implementation (Golden Cycles)
- Simple focused design
- TvDatafeed as the primary and only data source
- File-based pickle caching
- Clear error handling

### Current Implementation
- Compatibility layer that preserves the system's API expectations
- Uses the original implementation under the hood
- Maintains additional features like price source selection

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Run the system with different symbols and intervals
2. Verify data is correctly fetched and cached
3. Check that all visualizations and analysis features work properly

## Future Improvements
- Further streamline the data management system
- Add better error handling for TvDatafeed connection issues
- Improve cache management for long-running sessions
