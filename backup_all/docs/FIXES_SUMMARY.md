# Data Fetching Fixes Summary

The data fetching system has been restored to match the original golden cycles implementation.

## Key Changes

1. **Restored Original TvDatafeed-based Implementation**
   - Simplified code and improved reliability
   - Removed complex and error-prone multi-source logic

2. **Preserved Compatibility**
   - Created adapter layer to ensure system continues to work
   - Maintained existing API interfaces

3. **Improved Stability**
   - Original caching mechanism prevents data corruption
   - Direct TvDatafeed usage ensures consistent data quality

## Files Modified

- `data/fetcher.py` - Replaced with original implementation
- `data/data_management.py` - Converted to compatibility layer

## How to Test

Run the dashboard or scanner with:
```bash
python main_dashboard.py
```

Or for a specific symbol:
```bash
python main.py --mode scan --symbols NIFTY
```

Verify that data is correctly loaded, cached, and displayed.
