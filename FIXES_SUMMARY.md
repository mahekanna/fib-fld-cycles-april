# Fibonacci Cycles System - Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address issues in the Fibonacci Cycles Trading System.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical Interval Selection Issue
**Problem:** Unrecognized intervals would silently default to daily data without any error indication, causing confusion and incorrect analysis.

**Fix:**
- Modified `fetcher.py` to explicitly raise an error when an invalid interval is provided
- Ensured that all valid interval formats (like '15m', '15min', etc.) are properly recognized
- Added clear error messages to help troubleshoot interval selection issues

### 2. Lookback Parameter Not Respected
**Problem:** The system would hardcode data display to 250 bars regardless of the user-set lookback parameter value.

**Fix:**
- Updated `scanner_system.py` to use the user-specified lookback parameter in chart generation
- Ensured that the lookback parameter is stored in the result object for reference
- Verified that visualization code respects the lookback value

### 3. Missing Backtesting Files
**Problem:** Files required for the backtesting functionality were missing from the main directory.

**Fix:**
- Restored missing backtesting files from the backup directory
- Created and organized proper directory structure for backtesting modules
- Verified backtesting imports and dependencies

### 4. Dashboard Duplicate Callback Issues
**Problem:** There were errors related to duplicate callbacks in the dashboard due to overlapping output targets.

**Fix:**
- Added HTML container divs to serve as callback targets, preventing duplicates
- Fixed `advanced_backtest_ui.py` to use different UI elements for callbacks
- Ensured proper parent-child relationships for dashboard components

### 5. Data Fetching System Simplification
**Problem:** The data fetching system had been overly complicated and moved away from the original implementation.

**Fix:**
- Verified that the previously restored original TvDatafeed-based implementation works properly
- Tested data fetching across different intervals and symbols
- Ensured compatibility with the rest of the system

### 6. Price Consistency Between Dashboard Tabs
**Problem:** Prices would change when switching between dashboard tabs, particularly between Batch Results and Batch Advanced Signals, leading to inconsistent trading signals.

**Fix:**
- Implemented a comprehensive state management system using the singleton pattern (`web/state_manager.py`)
- Created immutable snapshots of data using deep copying to prevent state modification
- Added visual indicators to show when using consistent snapshot data
- Implemented persistence to disk for potential recovery
- Modified dashboard components to use the state manager for data retrieval
- For complete details, see `docs/STATE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.md`

## Verification
A comprehensive test script (`test_fixes.py`) was created to verify all fixes, covering:
1. Interval handling - ensuring correct intervals are used and invalid ones raise proper errors
2. Lookback parameter respect - ensuring visualization uses the correct lookback
3. Data fetching with TvDatafeed - ensuring reliable data retrieval

Additionally, `test_state_management.py` was created to verify:
4. Correct singleton implementation of the state manager
5. Immutability of data snapshots
6. Batch registration and retrieval
7. State persistence and recovery

All tests pass successfully, confirming that the issues have been fixed.

### 7. Details Button Price Inconsistency
**Problem:** The "Details" button in Batch Advanced Signals was bypassing the state management system, causing inconsistent prices between the batch table and detail view.

**Fix:**
- Modified the details button callback to use the state manager's immutable snapshots
- Completely disabled real-time price fetching in detail views
- Added additional logging to track detail view price consistency
- Implemented explicit warnings when a snapshot is not found in the state manager

### 8. Inefficient Batch Scanning for Large Symbol Lists
**Problem:** The batch scanning process was inefficient for large symbol lists, requiring a complete rescan of all symbols and offering no way to pause/resume.

**Fix:**
- Implemented incremental batch scanning with progress tracking
- Added pause and resume functionality for long-running scans
- Created a comprehensive scan state management system
- Added UI components to monitor scan progress
- Added documentation in `INCREMENTAL_SCANNING.md` and `INCREMENTAL_SCANNING_USAGE.md`

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the fixed system
2. Verify price consistency between tabs during actual usage
3. Test the incremental scanning with large symbol lists
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
5. Consider implementing automated tests to prevent regression of these issues
6. Expand the state management system to cover more dashboard components if needed
