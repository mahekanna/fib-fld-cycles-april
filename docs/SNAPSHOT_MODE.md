# Snapshot Mode: Simple Price Consistency Solution

## The Problem

The Fibonacci Cycles System had a persistent issue where prices would change when switching between different dashboard tabs. This caused inconsistencies in trading signals, where a symbol might show as STRONG BUY in one view and STRONG SELL in another.

Despite multiple complex fixes, the issue persisted due to the way Dash rebuilds components when tabs are switched.

## The Solution: Snapshot Mode

Instead of trying to manage the complex state transitions between dashboard components, we've implemented a simple "Snapshot Mode" that:

1. Takes a complete, immutable copy (snapshot) of each result object the first time it's seen
2. Stores these snapshots in a static dictionary keyed by symbol
3. Always uses the frozen snapshots instead of any live data

```python
# Simple cache to store snapshot copies of result objects
_result_snapshots = {}

# Create snapshots the first time we see results
if not _result_snapshots or any(...):
    for result in results_list:
        # Create a complete snapshot copy for this symbol
        import copy
        _result_snapshots[result.symbol] = copy.deepcopy(result)

# Always use snapshots instead of live results
snapshot_results = [_result_snapshots[r.symbol] for r in results_list 
                  if hasattr(r, 'symbol') and r.symbol in _result_snapshots]
results_list = snapshot_results
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Complete Isolation**: Snapshots are immune to any changes in the system
2. **Zero Dependencies**: No reliance on complex callback chains or state management
3. **Predictable Results**: Signals will always be the same regardless of navigation
4. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand mechanism with minimal code

## How It Works

1. When a batch scan is first run, we take complete snapshots of each result
2. When the user returns to the Batch Advanced Signals tab, we:
   - Ignore the live results that would normally be provided
   - Use our frozen snapshots instead
   - Generate signals based on these immutable snapshots

This ensures that even if the system tries to fetch new data or refresh prices, the Batch Advanced Signals view will remain consistent with what the user first saw.

## How To Use

Nothing special is required from the user. Just:

1. Run a batch scan
2. View results in any tab
3. Switch to Batch Advanced Signals or back and forth between tabs

Prices and signals will remain consistent across all views.

If you want to see updated market data, simply run a new batch scan. This will create new snapshots with fresh data.

## Debugging

Snapshot Mode adds clear logging with ðŸ“¸ emoji to help track what's happening:

```
ðŸ“¸ SNAPSHOT: Created immutable snapshot of NIFTY @ price 22399.15
ðŸ“¸ SNAPSHOT MODE: Using frozen data for NIFTY
ðŸ“¸ USING 8 SNAPSHOTS instead of live results
```

Look for these log messages to confirm snapshots are being used correctly.
