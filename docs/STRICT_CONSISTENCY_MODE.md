# Strict Consistency Mode Implementation

## Problem Summary

Even after implementing multiple fixes for price consistency between dashboard components, the issue persisted when switching between tabs. Specifically:

1. When initially running a batch scan, prices and signals in Batch Results and Batch Advanced Signals were consistent
2. When navigating to other tabs and returning to Batch Advanced Signals, the system would display different prices and contradictory signals

Example of inconsistency:
- Initial Batch Advanced Signals: `RELIANCE @ ₹1185.35 - STRONG SELL`
- After tab navigation: `RELIANCE @ ₹1181.20 - STRONG BUY`

This indicated that data was being refreshed or reloaded when returning to tabs, rather than maintaining the original state.

## Root Cause Analysis

After deep investigation, we identified multiple issues:

1. **Dash Component Lifecycle**: When switching tabs, components are recreated rather than preserved
2. **Result Object References**: Each rebuild was creating new objects rather than referencing original ones
3. **Data Refresh Attempts**: The system was actively trying to refresh prices to show real-time data
4. **Data Loading Fallbacks**: Multiple fallback mechanisms were attempting to fetch fresh data
5. **Variable Scope Issues**: Local variable storage wasn't persisting between tab switches

## Strict Consistency Mode Solution

We implemented a comprehensive "Strict Consistency Mode" that:

1. **Completely Disables** all data refreshing and real-time price fetching
2. **Preserves Objects** using global storage rather than function-level storage
3. **Skips** any symbols that don't have complete data attached rather than fetching it
4. **Forces** all components to use only original data from the scan results

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Global Object Storage**:
   ```python
   # GLOBAL BATCH RESULT STORAGE - Will hold the actual result objects
   # across dashboard components without re-fetching data or recreating objects
   _batch_result_objects = []

   # Flag to track if we should use strict mode
   _strict_consistency_mode = True
   ```

2. **Disabled Real-time Price Fetching**:
   ```python
   # CRITICAL FIX: COMPLETELY DISABLE real-time price fetching
   logger.warning(f"STRICT CONSISTENCY MODE: Skipping real-time price check")
   ```

3. **Skip Incomplete Data**:
   ```python
   # CRITICAL FIX: IF DATA IS MISSING, SKIP THE SYMBOL ENTIRELY
   if not hasattr(result, 'data') or result.data is None:
       logger.error(f"STRICT CONSISTENCY: {result.symbol} has no data - SKIPPING")
       continue
   ```

4. **Clear Debugging Information**:
   ```python
   logger.warning(f"STRICT CONSISTENCY MODE: Using {len(_batch_result_objects)} STORED batch results")
   for i, result in enumerate(_batch_result_objects[:5]):
       logger.warning(f"BATCH RESULT [{i}]: {result.symbol} @ price {result.price}")
   ```

## Benefits of Strict Consistency Mode

1. **Guaranteed Consistency**: Prices and signals remain exactly the same across all dashboard views
2. **Predictable Behavior**: Users get a consistent experience regardless of navigation patterns
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates race conditions and timing issues with data refreshing
4. **Clear Debugging**: All operations log their data source explicitly

## Limitations

1. **No Real-time Updates**: Prices don't update automatically (this is by design)
2. **Requires Explicit Refresh**: Users must run a new batch scan to see updated prices
3. **Incomplete Data Skipping**: Symbols without data attached are skipped rather than loaded on-demand

## Usage Instructions

Strict Consistency Mode is enabled by default. To see fresh market data, users should:

1. Run a new batch scan to get the latest prices
2. The system will maintain those exact prices throughout the session
3. Prices and signals will remain 100% consistent between all dashboard components

## Future Improvements

1. **User-Controlled Mode**: Add a toggle for users to switch between "Consistency Mode" and "Real-time Mode"
2. **Data Aging Indicators**: Show when data was last refreshed in the UI
3. **Selective Refreshing**: Allow refreshing individual symbols without breaking consistency
